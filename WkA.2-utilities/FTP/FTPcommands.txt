Using FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

NOTE: Use the command "sftp", which uses the same commands but
encrypts the connection.


1) Connecting:

    sftp username@that.machine.there.com


2) Transferring files:

    put name_of_file

    get name_of_file

   If a filename is illegal on the receiving machine, you can give
   a name:

       put local_name_of_file shortname

   will take the file on your machine and give it the name "shortname"
   on the other machine.  (Get can do the same thing.)


      mput file_name_with_wildcards
      mget file_name_with_wildcards

   does the same as put/get, but you can put * or ? in the filename.
   So you can "mget *.c" and get a bunch of files at once.


3) Other commands

    dir  - makes a list of files
    cd   - change directory on remote machine
    lcd  - change directory on local machine
    lls  - list files on local machine

    help - get help

    quit - end session
